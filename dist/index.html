        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Like an astronaut, I am logical and curious, and I love exploring the unknown.

          I am a computer science student at the University of Kansas. I am interested in using computer science to build meaningful tools. I have experience creating useful website components from my internship this past summer, and I am looking to learn new ways to use software to solve challenging problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am currently learning about many exciting aspects of computer science. Outside of school, I am attending lectures from Brian McClendon to learn about key components of technology startups. In school, I am studying machine learning, data structures, computer architecture, and software engineering. This summer I’d like to apply what I’ve learned in a professional setting and keep learning from experts.

          <h2>My Experience</h2>
          <p>
            I worked for a small IT consulting firm last summer. Most of my projects were centered around working on the internal company website of one of our clients, an engineering firm. Using Vue.js and Laravel I designed several UI components for the new site that we were building for them.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first component I created was a workload report visualization using Highcharts.js to track productivity. With this first project I used an external library and fetched data using API calls and Laravel routing. 
          </p>
          <p>
            For my other coding projects, I worked to refactor various existing components and add additional features. Most of the code I refactored involved changing from one component library to another, Vuetify to Syncfusion. Through this refactoring, I got accustomed to reading documentation to understand how the different components functioned. A particular feature that I added included notification options for project managers. This involved a modal that allowed managers to select departments or employees to notify from a list that queried the employee database. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Aside from my projects, I was introduced to many different aspects of IT. I was shown different automation tools, such as Power Automate, and PowerShell. I was also able to see how server and database hosting is set up through AWS.

        <h2>Some of my Projects</h2>
        <p>
          Currently, for my senior capstone project, I am working on a team to create a virtual reality environment that enables a one-on-one educational interaction. Using Unity we plan to make an environment that allows an educator and a student to be present with one another, virtually, to facilitate remote office hours or tutoring. The environment would be equipped with writing utensils and virtual desktops, to aid in demonstrating ideas.
        </p>

          For HackKU2022 I recreated a physical puzzle that I own: the Tetris Cube. My hackathon project utilized Three.js, a JavaScript library used to display 3D graphics with WebGL. During the hackathon I learned the basics of Three.js, such as initializing the scene, renderer, camera, objects, and mouse controls. Check out the project <a href="https://ethanosorio.github.io/TetrisCube/" class="hyperlink">here</a>. I’m a great spatial thinker, so this was a very fun project for me. This website is even made with Three.js.

          In my software engineering class, I worked on several collaborative group projects. Our first project involved creating the game Battleship. My group utilized C++ to make a simple version of it to play in the terminal. Our second project was to build upon another group's Battleship game by adding new features to it. The second Battleship game was built using Pygame in Python. I restructured the code to allow for a single-player game mode with three difficulty settings. I implemented the easy game mode, which set up my teammates to implement the other two modes. Check out the project <a href="https://github.com/ethanoso/Team2-Project2" class="hyperlink">here</a>.
